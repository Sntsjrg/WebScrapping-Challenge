# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

## Background

Embark on a comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis project, utilizing skills like identifying HTML elements, 'id', and 'class' attributes. Leverage automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup to extract information from the Mars news site, including HTML tables and recurring elements like news articles.

## Requirements

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- Employ automated browsing (Splinter) to visit the Mars news site and extract HTML code
- Scrape and extract titles and preview text of news articles
- Store the information in a specified Python data structure, a list of dictionaries

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Extract the HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame using Pandas, Splinter, and BeautifulSoup
- Ensure correct column headings and data types
- Analyze the data to address key questions:
   - How many months exist on Mars?
   - How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
- Analyze and visualize data to answer additional questions:
   - Identify the months with the lowest and highest average temperature.
   - Identify the months with the lowest and highest average atmospheric pressure.
   - Provide a visual estimate of terrestrial days in a Martian year within a 25% margin
- Export the DataFrame into a CSV file

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates our proficiency in web scraping, data analysis, and visualization. The exported CSV file provides a shareable format for further exploration. Overall, this experience enhances our skills in deriving valuable insights from web data, applicable across various data science scenarios.
